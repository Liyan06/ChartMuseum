Question: [QUESTION]

Please first generate your reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. Use the following format:

<think> 
... your thinking process here ... 
</think> 
<answer> 
... your final answer (entity(s) or number) ...
</answer>"""


COMPARE_ANSWER_PROMPT = """You are provided with a question and two answers. Please determine if these answers are equivalent. Follow these guidelines:

1. Numerical Comparison:
   - For decimal numbers, consider them as equivalent if their relative difference is sufficiently small. 
   For example, the following pairs are equivalent:
    - 32.35 and 32.34
    - 90.05 and 90.00
    - 83.3% and 83.2%
    - 31 and 31%
   The following pairs are not equivalent:
   - 32.35 and 35.25
   - 90.05 and 91.05
   - 83.3% and 45.2%

   Note that if the question asks for years or dates, please do the exact match with no error tolerance.

2. Unit Handling:
   - If only one answer includes units (e.g. '$', '%', '-', etc.), ignore the units and compare only the numerical values
   For example, the following pairs are equivalent:
   - 305 million and 305 million square meters
   - 0.75 and 0.75%
   - 0.6 and 60%
   - $80 and 80
   The following pairs are not equivalent:
   - 305 million and 200 million square meters
   - 0.75 and 0.90%

3. Text Comparison:
   - Ignore differences in capitalization
   - Treat mathematical expressions in different but equivalent forms as the same (e.g., "2+3" = "5")

Question: [QUESTION]
Answer 1: [ANSWER1]
Answer 2: [ANSWER2]

Please respond with:
- "Yes" if the answers are equivalent
- "No" if the answers are different"""
